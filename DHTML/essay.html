            <p><div style="text-indent: 33px;">If authors use non-standard additions
            to HTML they may encounter a few problems leaving them and their audience in
            frustration. Not all web browsers support the additions authors may use so it is
            best to avoid them unless they are certain it will work for whoever they are trying
            to attract to their pages. Since certain texts may not appear or sound the way they
            were coded using non-standard additions, it may cause confusion for those who use the
            accessibility features.</div></p>
            
            <p><div style="text-indent: 33px;"> Authors should use CSS styles to create or add more
            designs to their pages instead of using additions that may not even work for half their
            audience. Using CSS will help authors achieve desired affects for their pages that will
            leave their readers intrigued. Whoever chooses to use non-standard additions has the right
            to since they are not breaking the law. Out of etiquettes though, the proper thing to do
            would be to stick to standards. It may seem unfair for those who follow standards that others
            do not, but following standards helps authors avoid unnecessary and extra problems when creating
            their pages. </div></p>
            
            <p><div style="text-indent: 33px;">I believe HTML5 will soon introduce some sort of multimedia
            platform similar to Flash or even work with Flash so that developers have more opportunities to
            create things. HTML5 may take over Flash in the long run since many site developers are shifting
            towards HTML. However, Flash supports games better than HTML so that being said, I believe Flash
            has a long way unless HTML manages to create better support for gaming in the near future.</div></p>
